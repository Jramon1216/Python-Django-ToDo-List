# Python Django ToDo List w/ Authentication

This project is a pure python django project that I made following along with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llbtoQTt4qw "tutorial").

This was my first exposure to using class based views and Django Template Language to create a static web page. There were some things that I did differently from the tutorial and some planned features to deepen my understanding of using django.

------------

## Planned features
- Using ajax for a "search as you type" feature for an easier search experience
- Simplifying the process of completing a task by clicking the icon instead of going into the form
- A "Complete All" button
