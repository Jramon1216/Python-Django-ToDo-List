# Static Web Page with Django Class-Based Views w/ Authentication

This project is a pure Python Django project that I made following along with this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llbtoQTt4qw "tutorial").

This project marked my first foray into using class-based views and the Django Template Language to develop a static web page. Unlike the tutorial, I implemented several features differently to deepen my understanding of Django's capabilities.
------------
## Key Highlights:
**Class-Based Views**: Leveraged the power of Django's class-based views to streamline and organize the codebase.
**Django Template** Language (DTL): Employed DTL to create a dynamic and efficient template system.

## Planned features
- Using ajax for a "search as you type" feature for an easier search experience
- Simplifying the process of completing a task by clicking the icon instead of going into the form
- A "Complete All" button
